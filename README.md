# AE Bank Web Application

This is a banking website or application called AE Bank. The AE Bank program offers a safe online space for users to handle and distribute private documents by mimicking the type of file security needed in a banking environment. The program focusses on giving users a safe space to upload, encrypt, and store data while also enabling safe file exchange with authorised users. The program uses encryption to guarantee the privacy and accuracy of user data. Triple DES encryption will be used for files submitted to the platform, providing an extra degree of protection for data while it is at rest. On the other hand, encryption keys are managed and safely shared using RSA encryption. Only authorised users will be able to decrypt and see shared data thanks to this dual-encryption technique, which will enable controlled access. By doing this, AE Bank aims to show how encryption can be included into banking apps to safely and easily safeguard private data.
